				<div class="h5-responsive font-weight-bold text-white wow fadeIn">INTRODUCION</div>
				<div class="h6-responsive text-white wow fadeIn">
				<p>The Pakistan Parkinson’s Society was founded by Haroon Basheer in 2008. Haroon was the former country general manager of Citibank and American Express and had a busy social life before he was diagnosed with Parkinson’s in 2005. A few years after his diagnosis he founded the Pakistan Parkinson’s Society to assist people with Parkinson’s, and change the perception of Parkinson’s as a life-ending illness. Unfortunately, Harooon passed away in January 2018..</p>
				<p>At the Pakistan Parkinson’s Society, we aim to help those living with Parkinson’s, as well educate their caregivers and families about the disease. This is done via organising support groups, talks and annual Unity Walks. Our most recent Unity Walk was in March 2018 (all images in this feature are from the event).</p>
				<p>Due to the lack of resources, we have not been able to meet all our objectives for the country. However, we are actively looking at new ways to increase the number of specialised professionals and carers in more rural parts of Pakistan.</p>
				</div>
		<div class="h5-responsive font-weight-bold text-white text-uppercase wow fadeIn">A free-for-all membership</div>
		<div class="h6-responsive text-white wow fadeIn">
		<p>Initially, we charged an annual membership fee but owing to insufficient response, we abolished this charge. Anyone can now join our society at no cost and attend our events, seminars and group meetings.</p>
		<p>We host regular meetings on the first Thursday of each month and have a variety of speakers who make presentations to raise awareness, increase knowledge and provide support for the Parkinson’s community. We also hold support group meetings in association with the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), Karachi, Pakistan.</p>
		<p>In addition, we also host seminars and talks on World Parkinson’s Day and arrange an annual partnership walk at the AKUH in Karachi. The aim of the walk is to encourage individuals to interact with the Parkinson’s community in Pakistan.</p>

		<div class="h5-responsive font-weight-bold text-white text-uppercase wow fadeIn">Walking canes for people with Parkinson’s</div>
		<div class="h6-responsive text-white wow fadeIn">
		<p>One initiative our society is involved in is the distribution of free walking canes among Parkinson’s patients to prevent falls. The distribution was carried out by the Neurology Department of Jinnah Civil Hospital – who also offer free medical care for poorer patients.</p>
		<p>Despite these positives, very little support for treatment is available in Pakistan. Public hospitals are ill-equipped with regards to both their skillsets and infrastructure, which limits the access of quality care for patients in rural areas.</p>
		<div class="h5-responsive font-weight-bold text-white text-uppercase wow fadeIn">Spreading care in rural areas</div>
		<div class="h6-responsive text-white wow fadeIn">
		<p>We are passionate about supporting rural areas of Pakistan by providing free care and translated publications, however we are sometimes limited by our lack of financial resources and staff.</p>
		<p>To support those living in more rural areas we have translated many of our publications into Urdu. We also recently published ‘Parkinson’s Disease: Q and A’, ‘My life My PD booklet of GSK’ and ‘Exercise for the Parkinson’s Patients’ in addition to our periodic newsletter.</p>
		<p>There is an acute shortage of qualified and experienced neurologists in Pakistan. The neurologists in the country are mostly concentrated in the urban areas, therefore making it very difficult for people with Parkinson’s symptoms in the rural areas to contact specialists and get timely help.</p>
		<p>To combat this problem we aim to assist medical students who are interested in studying neurology. There are more than half a million people in Pakistan with Parkinson’s and they have limited access to qualified neurologists and medication.</p>
		<p>They usually end up going to general practitioners or family doctors with limited knowledge of the early symptoms of the disease.</p>

		<p>The Pakistan Society of Neurology, who assist our society, has published the “National Guidelines for Diagnosis and Management of Parkinson’s Disease in Pakistan” to help GPs detect and provide support for Parkinson’s. The principal author of the guideline is Dr Nadir Ali Syed, a leading neurologist in Pakistan who is also the vice chairman of the board of the Pakistan Parkinson’s Society.</p>
		<p>The biggest success of the Pakistan Parkinson’s Society has been creating awareness in the country to ensure timely diagnosis and medical care. Our focus has also been to provide support regardless of the individual’s financial situation.</p>
		<p>The society would be grateful to receive any support or contributions from any individual or organisation who are able to help us assist the Parkinson’s community in Pakistan.</p>

		<div class="h5-responsive font-weight-bold text-white text-uppercase wow fadeIn" align="left">Message Received from European Parkinson’s Disease Association (EPDA)</div>
		<div class="h6-responsive text-white wow fadeIn">
		<p><strong>#UniteForParkinsons</strong> is a global campaign that aims to raise awareness of Parkinson’s and to grow an active global Parkinson’s community. Last year, people from 90 countries used the <strong>#UniteForParkinsons hashtag;</strong> in 2018, we want to make an even bigger noise.</p>
		<p>We are now writing to ask you to help us on <strong>11 April 2018</strong> – World Parkinson's Day – to show the world what living with Parkinson's truly means: this year, <strong>we want to reach the broader public</strong>. And to do that we want to focus on <strong>sharing simple videos and film footage</strong> that shows the individual challenges people with Parkinson’s have to face in their daily lives.</p>
		<p>We hope therefore that you and members of the Pakistan Parkinson's Society will be able to take part in the campaign by <strong>telling your own stories on video.</strong></p>
		<p>What we are asking campaign supporters to do is very simple:</p>
		<li>Record a short video using your smartphone, camera or any device.</li>
		<li>Keep it short and simple, and make sure your audio is clear.</li>
		<li>Tell your own story! Show us your world. People need to hear your voice, appreciate your challenges and feel your successes. They need to know how Parkinson's affects your life today. Tell us: what's the most important thing to you right now?</li>
		<li>Be honest. Be brave. Be real.</li>
		<li>Please be aware that your video does not need to be in English – it can be in any language.</li>
		<li>You can find some simple video guidelines here, or attached.</li>
		<li><strong>Once your video is ready, share it – but make sure you use the #UniteForParkinsons hashtag!</strong> Post it on Facebook, upload it on YouTube, share it on Twitter. Embed it into your personal website or blog, if you have one. Get it out there, so as many people as possible can watch it and be inspired to do the same as you.</li>
		<li><strong>But above all: please remember to share your video again – using the #UniteForParkinsons hashtag – on World Parkinson’s Day, 11 April 2018. That is the big day where our united voice will count the most.</strong> All the thousands of videos will then appear together on the <a href="https://uniteforparkinsons.org/"><span class="text-dark font-weight-bold">campaign</span></a> website in a ‘virtual wall’.</li>
		<p class="mt-2">We have also put together a campaign toolkit, available in seven languages (English, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Spanish and Welsh), that clearly explains what the #UniteForParkinsons campaign is, and what we are asking supporters to do. The toolkit is available for download at </p>
			<a href="https://uniteforparkinsons.org/downloads/" class="text-dark font-weight-bold">https://uniteforparkinsons.org/downloads/</a>
			<p>Since the Pakistan Parkinson's Society is a well-known and influential voice in the Parkinson’s community, we would be extremely grateful if you could <strong>spread the word about this campaign</strong> through among your contacts network in Pakistan, and help us make <strong>#UniteForParkinsons</strong> a truly global campaign.</p>
			<p>Furthermore, if you could provide us with contacts of Parkinson’s organisations, patients associations and stakeholders in your area that could be willing to support the <strong>#UniteForParkinsons</strong> campaign, we would be absolutely delighted.</p>
			<p>We know we are asking a lot but, as we hope you will understand, we are really keen to raise unprecedented awareness about Parkinson’s on 11 April, and we believe #UniteForParkinsons is a great way to do that.</p>
			<p><strong>Thank you very much in advance for your help!</strong> If you need more information about this campaign, please do not hesitate to contact us at worldpdday@epda.eu.com or visit<a href="https://uniteforparkinsons.org/"><span class="font-weight-bold text-dark"> uniteforparkinsons.org.</span></a></p>
